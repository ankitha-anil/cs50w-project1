Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Bookshere is a user-friendly and efficient web application made using HTML, Python, Flask and SQL where you can access information of about 5000 books and add your reviews and ratings as well as access other user's reviews and ratings of any book. 

It is a web application where the users information is stored and the user can log out any time. Additionally, new users can register with necessarry information. You can search for any book within the home page based on the book's title, author or ISBN number. From the results of the search, you are directed to the page showcasing the books information as well as other user's reviews and ratings. You can submit only one review per book and if not errors will be raised. Furthermore, an additional feature, the History page, displays the previous reviews submitted by the user. 

Within the templates folder there exists the html files for the web application, inclusive of 2 layout files (One for login and signup and the other for home, search, history files) and home, search, history, login and register files. The static files contain the background images and Bookshere icon.
